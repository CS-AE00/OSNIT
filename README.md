Most users, except for the higher up people use their names.The people that seem to be the more involved or "hackers" have handles without their full names.

After investigation, the respected members of this crime group do not like ignorance to hacking or computer knowledge. They want people to do the work and not ask stupid questions. Most of the chats are in Russian, however, some of them speak english. For hacking information, they speak in russian and most replies are in russian. Promoting oneself or asking for hackers is a big no no. Mama J comments on a lot of those telling everyone to not trust. They value trust and respect of people willing to put in the work to learn. There are numerous chats poking fun at humanity or certain cultures (asians and american). The users send lots of memes about computer jokes or politics. The respected members like to post about taking advantage of peoples mistakes or weakness in peoples programs. However, they don’t brag that they are doing this. They simply say "don’t you love when…". A lot of respect can be gained from posting projects and asking for opinions or ways to better your project. One member posted the wolfgangsteakhouse[.]co exploit we looked at in the past.

Using the easter egg from the binary/password that we were able to reverse engineer, the group is probably looking for people who can help with this..http://www.shipparts[.]supÂ is wide open to an LFI exploit. You can get at the password files if you modify the POST request for the product variable on the home page. Burp makes it easy. Grab the hashes and John the Ripper cracks them easily if you want to play with it. The Web Master has sudo rights. Trolling is so much fun.
